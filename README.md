**MDmp3**, short for Makoto's Diegetic MP3 Player, aims to overhaul the in game music from the perspective of what would be on his titular audio device.  

CONCEPT
=======

In this pursuit, I am sticking to a few rules.  

*   All music must have been released before 2009
*   The genres chosen must match Makoto's characterization
*   Everything must sound like it's coming from Makoto's headphones  
    

* * *

TO DO
=====

*   ~~Add dialogue addressing Makoto's MP3 working in Tartarus~~
*   Add date conditionals to songs released in 2009
*   Add Japanese artists to playlists
 *   Coldrain added
*   Create monthly playlists to replace overworld BGM
*   ~~Normalize volume with vanilla BGM~~
*   Implement improved audio quality upon reaching Priestess Rank 10
